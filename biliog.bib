	abstract = {Density functional theory and density functional perturbation theory are used to investigate the electronic and vibrational properties of TiS2. Within the local density approximation the material is a semimetal both in the bulk and in the monolayer form. Most interestingly we observe a Kohn anomaly in the bulk phonon dispersion, which turns into a charge density wave instability when TiS2 is thinned to less than four monolayers. Such instability, however, disappears when one calculates the electronic structure with a functional, such as the LDA+U, which returns an insulating ground state. In this situation charge-doping or strain does not bring back the charge density wave instability, whereas the formation of the TiSSe alloy does.},

There are other layered systems, which could curl and bend, thus generating novel nanostructures with positive and negative Gaussian curvature. In this context, we will also demonstrate that hexagonal boron nitride, tungsten disulfide (WS2), molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and rhenium disulfide (ReS2) are also able to create nanocages, nanotubes and nano-arrangements exhibiting novel physico-chemical properties that could revolutionize materials science in the 21st century.},

At the Brillouin zone boundary at M(L) three peaks are found in the temperature dependent EDCs near EF whose intensity and binding energy vary continously, revealing the second order-type phase transition in the electronic properties accompanied by pretransition fluctuations. At low temperatures (T < Tc) these peaks are in good agreement with a recent band structure calculation of Suzuki et al., based on the band-type Jahn-Teller model, demonstrating the dominance of the electron-lattice interaction.},

@article{TiTe2_2,
	abstract = {The evolution of crystal-structure and chemical-bond characteristics is studied for the series of isotypical compounds TiX2, with X = S, Se, Te. The structure determination of TiTe2 and TiSeTe confirms the existence of an increasing trigonal C3v distortion of metal sites when the chalcogen electronegativity decreases. The ESCA study shows that this distortion is associated with augmentation of the covalent or metallic character of the bonds. The structural and spectroscopic differences appearing from TiS2 to TiSe2 can be interpreted by an orbital delocalization in TiSe2 and TiTe2, which would explain the semimetallic behavior of these compounds.

	abstract = {The occurrence of charge-density waves in three selected layered transition-metal dichalcogenides---1T-TaS2, 2H-TaSe2 and 1T-TiSe2---is discussed from an experimentalist's point of view with a particular focus on the implications of recent angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy results. The basic models behind charge-density-wave formation in low-dimensional solids are recapitulated, the experimental and theoretical results for the three selected compounds are reviewed, and their band structures and spectral weight distributions in the commensurate charge-density-wave phases are calculated using an empirical tight-binding model. It is explored whether the origin of charge-density waves in the layered transition-metal dichalcogenides can be understood in a unified way on the basis of a few measured and calculated parameters characterizing the interacting electron--lattice system. It is found that the predictions of the standard mean-field model agree only semi-quantitatively with the experimental data and that there is not one generally dominant factor driving charge-density-wave formation in this family of layer compounds. The need for further experimental and theoretical scrutiny is emphasized.},

These crystals were in platelet form, could all be readily cleaved, and had areas of up to 1 cm2. Measurements of optical absorption over the energy range 0.05 eV--2.5 eV showed that ZrS2, HfS2, HfSe2 and SnS2 were indirect gap semiconductors, (respective room temperature energy gaps: 1.68 eV, 1.96 eV, 1.13 eV and 2.21 eV). Measurements of reflectivity (energy range 1--12 eV) revealed a number of strong maxima in the joint density of states in the fundamental absorption region; from these results some tentative predictions about the energy band structure of these materials can be made. The measurements also reveal strong exciton effects deep in the fundamental absorption region of CdI2 itself. These results coupled with studies on the excitons in PbI2 and KBr support recent models put forward to explain the role of excitons and interband transitions in ionic crystals.},

Both compounds are found to be semimetals with Gamma -L overlaps of 0.24 and 0.55 eV, respectively. The positioning and occupation of the bands near the Fermi level are not consistent with the carrier densities determined from Hall measurements; however, agreement is obtained when the overlap is decreased by about 0.25 eV. Calculations performed with contracted lattice constants reproduce qualitatively the same trends in Hall coefficients as observed experimentally. However, quantitative agreement cannot be obtained without an overlap decrease of about 0.25 eV-indicating that TiSe2 is a semimetal and TiS2 a semiconductor.},

Below 40 kbar the transport properties may be understood within the framework of an extrinsic semiconductor model with strong electron-phonon scattering. Under pressure the band overlap is estimated to change at the rate of 4.5+or-1.5 meV kbar-1; this implies a band gap of 0.18+or-0.06 eV for TiS2 at ambient pressure. Analysis of the quantity -RH/ rho 2e as a function of pressure, and solution of the transport equations at 90 kbar are both used to show that in the semimetallic state of TiS2 the d-band electron mobility exceeds the p-band hole mobility. In contrast, the hole mobility is the greater at all pressures up to 90 kbar in TiSe2.},

	abstract = {A generalization of the local density approximation (LDA) method for systems with strong Coulomb correlations is described which gives a correct description of the Mott insulators. The LDA+U method takes into account orbital dependence of the Coulomb and exchange interactions which is absent in the LDA. The scheme can be regarded as a `first-principles' method because there are no adjustable parameters. When applied to the transition metal and rare-earth metal compounds, the LDA+U method gives a qualitative improvement compared with the LDA not only for excited-state properties such as energy gaps but also for ground-state properties such as magnetic moments and interatomic exchange parameters. The orbital-dependent rotationally invariant LDA+U potential gives a correct orbital polarization and a corresponding Jahn - Teller distortion as well as polaron formation.},

We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VAMP (Vienna ab-initio molecular-dynamics package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semi-conducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable.},

@article{PyMatgen,
	abstract = {We present the Python Materials Genomics (pymatgen) library, a robust, open-source Python library for materials analysis. A key enabler in high-throughput computational materials science efforts is a robust set of software tools to perform initial setup for the calculations (e.g., generation of structures and necessary input files) and post-calculation analysis to derive useful material properties from raw calculated data. The pymatgen library aims to meet these needs by (1) defining core Python objects for materials data representation, (2) providing a well-tested set of structure and thermodynamic analyses relevant to many applications, and (3) establishing an open platform for researchers to collaboratively develop sophisticated analyses of materials data obtained both from first principles calculations and experiments. The pymatgen library also provides convenient tools to obtain useful materials data via the Materials Project's REpresentational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API). As an example, using pymatgen's interface to the Materials Project's RESTful API and phasediagram package, we demonstrate how the phase and electrochemical stability of a recently synthesized material, Li4SnS4, can be analyzed using a minimum of computing resources. We find that Li4SnS4 is a stable phase in the Li--Sn--S phase diagram (consistent with the fact that it can be synthesized), but the narrow range of lithium chemical potentials for which it is predicted to be stable would suggest that it is not intrinsically stable against typical electrodes used in lithium-ion batteries.},
