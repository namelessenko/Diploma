There are other layered systems, which could curl and bend, thus generating novel nanostructures with positive and negative Gaussian curvature. In this context, we will also demonstrate that hexagonal boron nitride, tungsten disulfide (WS2), molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and rhenium disulfide (ReS2) are also able to create nanocages, nanotubes and nano-arrangements exhibiting novel physico-chemical properties that could revolutionize materials science in the 21st century.},

At the Brillouin zone boundary at M(L) three peaks are found in the temperature dependent EDCs near EF whose intensity and binding energy vary continously, revealing the second order-type phase transition in the electronic properties accompanied by pretransition fluctuations. At low temperatures (T < Tc) these peaks are in good agreement with a recent band structure calculation of Suzuki et al., based on the band-type Jahn-Teller model, demonstrating the dominance of the electron-lattice interaction.},

The structure determination of TiTe2 and TiSeTe confirms the existence of an increasing trigonal C3v distortion of metal sites when the chalcogen electronegativity decreases. The ESCA study shows that this distortion is associated with augmentation of the covalent or metallic character of the bonds. The structural and spectroscopic differences appearing from TiS2 to TiSe2 can be interpreted by an orbital delocalization in TiSe2 and TiTe2, which would explain the semimetallic behavior of these compounds.

The basic models behind charge-density-wave formation in low-dimensional solids are recapitulated, the experimental and theoretical results for the three selected compounds are reviewed, and their band structures and spectral weight distributions in the commensurate charge-density-wave phases are calculated using an empirical tight-binding model. It is explored whether the origin of charge-density waves in the layered transition-metal dichalcogenides can be understood in a unified way on the basis of a few measured and calculated parameters characterizing the interacting electron--lattice system. It is found that the predictions of the standard mean-field model agree only semi-quantitatively with the experimental data and that there is not one generally dominant factor driving charge-density-wave formation in this family of layer compounds. The need for further experimental and theoretical scrutiny is emphasized.},

The CCSD(T) correction term{,} determined as a difference between CCSD(T) and MP2 interaction energies{,} is evaluated with smaller basis sets (6-31G** and cc-pVDZ). Two sets of complex geometries were used{,} optimized or experimental ones. The JSCH-2005 benchmark set{,} which is now available to the chemical community{,} can be used for testing lower-level computational methods. For the first screening the smaller training set (S22) containing 22 model complexes can be recommended. In this case larger basis sets were used for extrapolation to the CBS limit and also CCSD(T) and counterpoise-corrected MP2 optimized geometries were sometimes adopted.},

@article{Anisimov1997,
	abstract = {A generalization of the local density approximation (LDA) method for systems with strong Coulomb correlations is described which gives a correct description of the Mott insulators. The LDA+U method takes into account orbital dependence of the Coulomb and exchange interactions which is absent in the LDA. The scheme can be regarded as a `first-principles' method because there are no adjustable parameters. When applied to the transition metal and rare-earth metal compounds, the LDA+U method gives a qualitative improvement compared with the LDA not only for excited-state properties such as energy gaps but also for ground-state properties such as magnetic moments and interatomic exchange parameters. The orbital-dependent rotationally invariant LDA+U potential gives a correct orbital polarization and a corresponding Jahn - Teller distortion as well as polaron formation.},
